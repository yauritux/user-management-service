## Prerequisites

You merely need `Docker` to run all of the services. 
You can grab it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Run The Services

1. Fire up your terminal and `cd` into `user-management-service` folder.
2. Running all of the services through this following command:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```
   and wait for couple minutes (it depends on your network speed).
   
## Shutdown the Services

1. You can stop all of the running services either by `CTRL+c` (break) or it's better to using this command which clean-up all unused resources:
   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```
